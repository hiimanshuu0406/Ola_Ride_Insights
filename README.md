# 🚖 OLA Analytics Dashboard
**📄 Summary of the Project**
 
This project was developed as part of my internship at Labmentix. The goal was to analyze OLA ride data to uncover insights into customer behavior, ride cancellations, driver performance, and revenue generation.
The project involved data cleaning, SQL-based querying, Power BI visualizations, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time analytics and decision-making.

**💼 Business Problem**
1. High number of ride cancellations by customers and drivers.
2. Unclear trends in ratings and revenue performance across vehicle types.
3. Need for a visual and data-driven way to understand key performance indicators (KPIs).

**🧭 Methodology**
1. Data Preparation: Cleaned and formatted over 100,000 ride records, handled missing and null values, and fixed data types.
2. SQL Analysis: Executed structured queries to extract insights on bookings, cancellations, ratings, and payments.
3. Visualization & Dashboard: Built interactive Power BI and Streamlit dashboards to visualize trends and metrics across vehicle types.

**🧰 Skills and Tools Used**
1. Python: Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. SQL: MySQL (for querying and analysis)
3. Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visual insights

**📊 Results and Business Recommendations**
1. Identified higher cancellation rates during certain hours and for specific vehicle types.
2. Found that Prime Sedan and SUV rides generate the highest revenue, while Auto and Bike rides are preferred for short distances.
3. Suggested improving driver incentives and availability during peak hours to reduce unmet demand.
4. Highlighted the need for rating-based performance monitoring to enhance customer satisfaction.
